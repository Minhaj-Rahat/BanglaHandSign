This project can predict 10 bangla signs in real time using kinect camera.

1.First Train the SVM Classifier using train.m. Save the train and test data in "data" directory under the names "train","test" respectively.
2.You can test the model using test.m
3. Use the "main.m" to run the code in real time using kinect camera after the model is trained
